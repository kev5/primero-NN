# primero-NN
Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch in Python.

## Data Generation
The dataset that is generated has two classes, plotted as red and blue points. You can think of the blue dots as male patients and the red dots as female patients, with the x- and y- axis being medical measurements.

## Plot with Hidden Layer size 3

We can see that our neural network was able to find a decision boundary that successfully separates the 2 classes.

## Comparison of different Hidden Layer sizes

We can see that a hidden layer of low dimensionality nicely captures the general trend of our data. Higher dimensionalities are prone to overfitting. They are “memorizing” the data as opposed to fitting the general shape. If we were to evaluate our model on a separate test set, the model with a smaller hidden layer size would likely perform better due to better generalization.

## To Sum Up

* We used Batch Gradient Descent to train the network.
* We used a fixed Learning Rate for gradient descent. In practice, the Learning Rate is gradually decreased (either linearly or exponentially). The reason behind this is that early on there is a clear learning signal so aggressive updates encourage exploration while later on the smaller learning rates allow for more delicate exploitation of local error surface.
* We used the **tanh** activation function for our hidden layer. More information about activation functions ![here](https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/tag/tanh-function/).
